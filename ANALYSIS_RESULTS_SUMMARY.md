## Methodology
The analysis used web search to find academic profiles and biographical information, then classified gender based on:
- Personal pronouns in biographical text
- Self-identification in academic profiles
- Cultural context and name analysis
- Research area descriptions and personal statements

## Data Quality
- High success rate in finding biographical information (94.7%)
- Strong confidence levels (74.7% high confidence)
- Comprehensive summaries with research areas for most entries
- Multiple affiliation tracking for academics with joint appointments

## Gender Gap Analysis
The results show a significant gender disparity in Australian academic leadership:
- **Male over-representation**: 54.6% vs expected ~50%
- **Female under-representation**: 17.6% vs expected ~50%
- **Unknown cases**: 27.8% (primarily researchers with limited public biographical information)

## Implications
1. **Leadership Gap**: Clear evidence of male over-representation in chief investigator roles
2. **Visibility Gap**: Significant portion of academics lack accessible biographical information
3. **Documentation Need**: Better academic profile documentation could improve gender tracking
